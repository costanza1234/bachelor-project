# TODO List

[ ] **Finish the tracker**

    missing:
        in QuestionPage,
            clicked: false,
            clickOrder: null,
            timeSpentOnPage: null

[ ] **The game does not restart if the web page is refreshed** This probably requires a game state, which could be merged with the tracker.

[ ] **Improve the download of the data for the researcher and the UI**

[ ] **Make the language of the game dynamic** Currently, the game is only in Italian.

[ ] **Clean up the code and comment everything**

[ ] **Add a comprehensive README.md file with a guide on how to run the code**
